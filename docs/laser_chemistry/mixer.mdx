The Mixer is a powerful machine that can mix and combine items in a variety of ways.

Materials can be inserted manually, note however that you can only input one ingredient

It requires laser power to operate. To display informations about the ongoing process, you can use the Monocle.

Its main purpose is to mix ingredients into chemicals like EAS or Etching Acid, used to infuse tools to unlock their full potential.
