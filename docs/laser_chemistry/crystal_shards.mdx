Prismarine Crystal Shards are a pristine
material required for some of the most
advanced machinery.

In order to obtain them you have to
use the Aquarine Steel Pickaxe with
its ability enabled and mine a Prismarine crystal.

Make sure that it has more than 100 power as that is
the amount it needs to preserve the drops.
