The Augmentation Station is the multiblock required
for applying augments to the player.

When looking at an augmentation recipe (in JEI) you
might realise that it takes in up to 4 ingredients.
These ingredients need to be supplied by putting them
into the 4 augmentation station extensions. Note that
for each ingredient you also need to add a robot arm.
