## Guardian Eye

The Guardian Eye gives you the ability to shoot a laser at the entity you are looking at, within a 15 block radius.
Note however, that in order to do this you need to hold down a keybind.

The item can be obtained as a rare drop from Guardians.

## Dolphin Fin

The Dolphin Fin affects you with the Dolphins Grace effect while swimming.

This allows you to explore the water more efficiently.

## Drowned Lung

The Drowned Lungs is one of the most powerful augments.

They allow you to breathe both underwater and on the surface

## Eldritch Heart

While this might not sound too overwhelming on its own, it is
worth noting, that the eldritch heart is also required for the
Augmentation Station.
