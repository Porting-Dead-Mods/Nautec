title: Crates Etching

Etching is a mechanic that allows you to remove the rust from rusty objects.

The process is simple, by dropping a rusty crate or item into a pool of etching acid, the rust will slowly disappear, and a new shiny object will emerge.

You probably noticed that the crates are locked, and you can't open them. This is because the lock is messed up and needs a crowbar to be removed.
